# Simple Shell

Simple Shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a basic set of shell commands for users to execute. It is a simplified version of the Linux shell, designed to be easy to use and understand.

## How to Use

To use Simple Shell, simply run the executable file in a terminal window. This will launch the shell and display a prompt, where you can enter commands.

The shell supports a number of built-in commands, such as "cd" (change directory) and "exit" (exit the shell). It also supports external commands, which are executed by invoking the corresponding executable file.

Here are some examples of how to use Simple Shell:

```
$ ./shell
> ls
Desktop    Documents    Downloads    Music    Pictures    Public    Templates    Videos
> cd Documents
> pwd
/home/user/Documents
> exit
$
```

## Features

Simple Shell provides the following features:

- Prompt: The shell displays a prompt, indicating that it is ready to accept commands.
- Command Execution: The shell can execute both built-in commands and external commands.
- I/O Redirection: The shell supports input/output redirection using the ">" and "<" operators.
- Background Execution: The shell supports running commands in the background by appending "&" to the end of the command.
- Command History: The shell stores a history of previously entered commands, which can be accessed using the up/down arrow keys.

## Limitations

Simple Shell has some limitations, including:

- Limited Set of Built-in Commands: The shell provides a basic set of built-in commands, and does not support more advanced commands like "grep" or "sed".
- Limited I/O Redirection: The shell only supports input/output redirection using the ">" and "<" operators, and does not support more advanced redirection options like ">>" or "|".
- Limited Shell Scripting: The shell does not support shell scripting or programming constructs like loops and conditionals.
